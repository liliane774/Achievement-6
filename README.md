Data Source and Collection:

The dataset is sourced from kaggle and contains daily weather observations for 10 major cities worldwide during
January and February 2025, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and general weather
conditions. The data is suitable for various analyses, such as weather prediction, climate studies, and time series
analysis and ongoing rise of the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and has been demonstrated by
direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.

Source: The dataset, compiled by Sudalai Rajkumar, aggregates daily average temperature values from weather
records for major cities globally, likely sourced from public weather databases or meteorological services.

Time Period: Covers multiple years, typically from 1995 to 2019 or 2020, as noted in related analyses .
Variables: Includes columns such as:
    Region: Geographic region (e.g., North America, Asia).
    Country: Country of the city.
    State (if applicable): State or province for certain countries
    City: Name of the city (e.g., New York, Tokyo).
    Month, Day, Year: Date of the temperature record.
    AvgTemperature: Daily average temperature (in Fahrenheit or Celsius, depending on the datasetâ€™s
    format).

Format: Provided as a CSV file (e.g., city_temperature.csv), with each row representing a daily temperature
record for a specific city.

Purpose: Designed for analyzing global temperature trends, climate change, or weather-related patterns,
useful for time series analysis, forecasting, or regional comparisons.

Data Quality: May include missing values or outliers (e.g.,-99 for invalid temperatures, as noted in Web
ID: 2), requiring cleaning before analysis.
